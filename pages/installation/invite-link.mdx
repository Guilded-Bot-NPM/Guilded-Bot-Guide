# Adding your bot to servers

Now, before we start coding, we need to invite our bot to our server.

## Bot Invite Links

The invite link of a bot look like this:
```txt
https://www.guilded.gg/b/d95e651d-60bb-456d-870f-361be4074820
```

The link is composed of 3 parts:

* `https://www.guilded.gg/` - The base URL of Guilded
* `b/` - The type of link, in this case a bot link
* `d95e651d-60bb-456d-870f-361be4074820` - The unique ID of the bot

## Creating and inviting bot with invite link

To invite your bot to any server, first we need to get the bot invitation link.

These are the steps you must follow:

- 1. Press three dots on the right side of the bot you want to invite
- 2. Click on "Publish bot"
