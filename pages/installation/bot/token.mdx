A bot token is a unique string that acts as a password for your bot. It is used to authenticate your bot when you make requests to the Guilded API.

A public id is a unique string that identifies what token is being used. It is used to authenticate your bot when you make requests to the Guilded API.

## Whats happens if I share my bot token?
